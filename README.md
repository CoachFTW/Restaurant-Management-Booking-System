## System Requirements

To run the **Restaurant Management System**, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Flask Framework**
- **SQLite** (for database)
- **ThingSpeak Account** (for data integration)
- **Web Browser** (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- **Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/restaurant-management-system.git
cd restaurant-management-system
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure the Database

Run the following commands in the Python shell to set up the database:

```bash
flask shell
from app import db
db.create_all()
exit()
```

This will create an SQLite database (`restaurant.db`) in the project directory.

---

## Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed and the database is set up, run the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start running locally at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## ThingSpeak Integration

### Step 1: Create a ThingSpeak Account

1. Go to [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/) and sign up.
2. Create a new channel.
3. Obtain the **API key** from the ThingSpeak channel settings.

### Step 2: Update `app.py`

In the `app.py` file, replace the placeholder `YOUR_THINGSPEAK_API_KEY` with your actual API key:

```python
THINGSPEAK_API_KEY = 'YOUR_THINGSPEAK_API_KEY'
```

The system will now send reservation, order, and payment data to your ThingSpeak channel.

---

## Usage

Once the project is up and running, you can access various features:

1. **Homepage (`index.html`):**
   - Start by choosing from the available options (make a reservation, place an order, process payment).
   
2. **Reservations:**
   - Navigate to the reservation page to book a table. Enter the required details (e.g., name, number of guests, date, and time).
   - The system will send the reservation data to ThingSpeak.

3. **Order Management:**
   - Place an order for a specific table. Add meal items to seats, and submit the order.

4. **ThingSpeak Monitoring:**
   - Visit your ThingSpeak channel to see live updates on reservations, orders, and payments.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication:**
  - Add authentication for waiters, chefs, and receptionists.
  
- **Payment:**
   - Process payments through credit cards, cash, or checks. Payments are reflected on ThingSpeak.
  
- **Advanced Table Layout:**
  - Add dynamic and customizable table layout for different branches.

- **Reporting & Analytics:**
  - Generate reports on orders, payments, and customer behavior using the ThingSpeak data.

- **Menu Customization:**
  - Add an interface for managers to dynamically update the restaurant menu.

- **Mobile Responsiveness:**
  - Enhance the front-end to be fully responsive on mobile devices.
